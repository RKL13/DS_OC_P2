# Analyze data on global educational systems

### Mission

We were asked to realize an exploratory data analysis to provide visualization and insights of a data set on global education systems to help an Ed-Tech start-up spot opportunities abroad. 

This was the occasion to strengthen our data cleaning skills before using univariate and multivariate analysis for feature selection to create a score to rank countries by their business potential.
